A tool for finding distinguishing terms in small-to-medium-sized corpora

The documentation (including this readme) is a work in progress.

There are term importance algorithms that have been implemented in this library that are not available anywhere else.  Feel free to poke around, make suggestions, and ask any questions while I figure out the docs.
